# Some tests with fetch

## Description
This is a very basic test about fetching data on a one page website. The idea is to use an asynchronous function to load different pages within the index page.

## Roadmap of future improvements
This can surely be improved. I am loading the home page within the index page because I didn't know how to do better. I originally want to add an h1 element within the index.html page and delete it when pricing or checkout are fetched.

## License
The code is an improvement from an MIT xPro exercise. I have also used the framework Bootstrap.
